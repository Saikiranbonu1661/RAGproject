to create a project:

1. install the dependencies

things to install for a project to run
(poetry, pyproject.toml) / requirements.txt

here we are using requirements.txt.
    To install command - pip install -r requirements.txt
        if pip is not there you have to install

if we use poetry:
    pyproject.toml -> deps are there
    pip install poetry
    poetry install

About project

RAG

steps: 
    ingestion
    retrieval
    generation

ingestion:
    given data -> chunks -> generate vector -> insert into db
retrival:
    user inputs text -> generate vector -> do cosine similarity on db -> get the relavant docs
generation:
    used those docs -> create a prompt -> pass the question, similar docs fetched from db along with prompt -> output


Things to learn:

    1. terminal commands like cd, ls etc....
    2. git and github? how to use? try with a sample project
    3. embeddings, similarity, semantic search, cosine similarity ....
